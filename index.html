<p>Over the last decade, machine learning (ML) has had a revolutionary impact on many fields of science and engineering. Problems once deemed impossible, such as automatic language translation, are now solved routinely thanks to ML. An example of a field undergoing revolutionary change thanks to ML is verification. Today's verification tools, such as SAT/SMT solvers, are ever more scalable thanks to their use of sophisticated ML methods. Conversely, ML needs verification and security because of increasingly sophisticated attacks on ML models. There is an urgent need for experts (theorists and practitioners) in these fields to work together, if ML is to continue to have significant impact and adoption.</p>
 
<p>The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo invites you to attend a week-long workshop, August 26 to August 30th, where we will bring together speakers who are world-renowned practitioners and theorists in ML, verification and security to speak on inter-disciplinary research being conducted on ML for verification+security, and verification+security for ML. The goal is not only to educate each other, but the next generation of researchers in this exciting new inter-disciplinary field.</p>
